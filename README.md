# Droplr Downloadr
Alfred workflow that downloads a screenshot taken by [Droplr](https://droplr.com/) to your Downloads folder. This may be useful if you need to upload a droplr file somewhere directly (like Trello or Email) but since Droplr doesn't save files locally, this isn't as simple as using Apple's default screenshot ability.

Currently only supports images.

# Installation & Usage
To install, just download the file and double click the workflow. Alfred should handle the rest.

To use, launch Alfred and use the keyword `drp` followed by the Droplr screenshot URL. This is the URL Droplr automatically adds to your clipboard when you take a screenshot with Droplr.
